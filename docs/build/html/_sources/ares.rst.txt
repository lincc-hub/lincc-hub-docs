Available Resources
===================

Disk space
----------

1TB of space shared by everyone. We can add more if (when) needed.

Computational resources
-----------------------
* Machines are available with different combinations of CPU, RAM, and GPU.
* Please use the smallest machine that can fit your workload (to help us conserve $$).
* Also, larger machines may take more time to start up (up to ~5 minutes).

You can access different server options by clicking *Need more CPU, memory, or a GPU... ?* on the Server Options page.
